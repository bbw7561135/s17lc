# s17lc
This is a repository for the radio light curve program used in [Sarbadhicary et al 2017](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.464.2326S). **Please cite the paper if you use the code for your project**. 

The code is a simply Python script written with Python 2.7, although it should work with higher versions. 

### Installation
You can do the following :-
1. If you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed, you can directly clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/sks67/s17lc.git` into your computer
2. Copy paste the `s17lc.py` into a blank `.py` file directly in your computer and use it accordingly.

### Description
The program `s17lc.py` is the coded up version of the equations A1-A11 in the paper. 

### Usage
I have included a Jupyter notebook, `test_s17lc.ipynb` to show how to generate radius, velocity, and light curves with the code.
